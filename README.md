Data Visualization
Final Project - Final Brief for West Team 3


The purpose of our dashboard is to serve as an urban improvement planning tool; the dashboard will allow the  South Bend Urban Planning Department and the Parks & Recreation District to view current public facilities and parks by city council districts. With this information, the representatives from these departments can identify the city districts with the most and fewest parks and public facilities. They will also be able to identify city council districts that have parks with specific features, such as basketball courts or swimming pools. This will help them identify districts whose residents do or do not have access to specific park features. The respective  departments can then justify the decision to suggest  the construction or renovation of a new park and/or public facilities. Once these needs for the city district have been determined, the dashboard can be used to find the local councilperson(s) that represent that district. Partnering with the local councilperson is crucial in moving the suggested improvements forward.

The dashboard will be sourcing the data from the following datasets:
- City Council Districts
- Parks Location and Features
- Public Facilities

The construction of the dashboard will be performed by Team West 3: Claire Harris, Jon Cordero, Raoul Fernandes. The work will be divided as follows:

1. Narrative/Write-up: All

2. Design:  All

3. Development of Mapping and Metrics: 

Tab 1: City Council Districts and Parks Location/Features (Claire Harris)
- Map of city council districts with park locations labeled
- Filter of park features to filter park locations by features
- Table of individual parks and features listed with counts. Only parks with greater than 0 features will be displayed.

Tab 2: City Council Districts and Public Facilities (Jon Cordero)
- Identifying the distribution of public facilities by City Council Districts to identify which districts have the most public services nearby
- Filter of public services to identify best city council districts 

Tab 3: Parks Location/Features and Public Facilities (Raoul Fernandes)
- Parks and public facilities mapped together
- Distances mapped from parks to the public facilities to visually identify the distances and identify which city council districts are planned better than the others
